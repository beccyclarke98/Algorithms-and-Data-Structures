C# application that will store and structure this data to allow fast and efficient searching (and other functionalities) via the company name. You are asked to implement a Binary Search or AVL tree, where each node corresponds to a specific company and its key economic data. The application must be able to read this data from a .csv file document.

An example of data file (with fictional but reasonable data) is provided on Moodle (companies.csv). 

Each line in the data file corresponds to a unique company. For a bare pass the built-in Dictionary collection can be used instead (though obviously much of the search functionality will be suboptimal). Your trees MUST use the recursive techniques covered in the lectures and labs as a starting  point.
